# Style Transfer Using Convolution Neural Network

###### Implemented the approach provided in the paper [link](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). Used CNN model to extract the features and transfer style maintaing the integrity of the original image.


### Outline to use the repo

Github contain a ipynb file containing the code.
Repo also contains the style image and content image change the path of content image path and style image path
You can aslo upload the ipynb file onto colab and upload images and run the code
